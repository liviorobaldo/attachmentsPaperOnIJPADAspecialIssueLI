These two files contain the codes used in the example of the paper "_Amantea, I.A. and Robaldo, L. and Governatori, G. and Sulis, E. and Boella, G. Business process modelling in healthcare and compliance management: a logical framework. Currently under submission in: Special Issues on Foundational Approaches, Methods and Cases in Legal Informatics. In International Journal of Public Administration in the Digital Age (IJPADA)._"
 
The paper presents a real and innovative hospital process for home care and the control of its regulatory compliance according to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, the following links contain the formalization of some provisions of the GDPR and not the entire legislation, but only those that affect the actual process examined.
 
The work starts from the formalization of these rules in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legalruleml">the LegalRuleML standard</a>. The LegalRuleML version was later translated in Defeasible Deontic Logic in order to make it executable for compliance checking in <a href="https://research.csiro.au/data61/regorous">the Regorous reasoner</a> for Defeasible Deontic Logic developed at <a href="https://research.csiro.au/data61/">Data61</a>.
